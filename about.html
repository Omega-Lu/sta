                    <p>Growing up I became good with electronics, I played my first computer game at the age of 2
                        and managed to accidentally delete work content from my dad's laptop because I thought yes was THE answer to everything.
                        I took an interest in IT after my first year in varsity where I changed my course from Bcom General to Bcom Informatics.
                        Throughout the course of my studies, I began to enjoy web-development (more front-end than backend) and aspire to build mini systems
                        for future aspiring IT wizards to help them learn and start building my own systems to help small growing business so that they can carry
                        out their duties better and more efficiently. I am a quick learner, adaptive, I always yearn to know more and apply what I learnt to build
                        better systems than the preexisting ones. I have an interest in gaming and one day would like to head towards game design and development and start
                        building better teaching because I always think that the youth lately are so invested in their devices and consoles and companies and the government
                        are not utilizing this current revolution to the best of their abilities.
